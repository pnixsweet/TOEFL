<h2>Your Instructor</h2>

I'm your instructor Eric. Here's some my background might intrigue you. I graduated from University of Washington, Seattle with a Bachelor of Science in Biologicial science with a minor in Applied Math and another minor in Music - becuase i like classical music and me, myself play classical guitar. I was, and still, yes, a member of Seattle Classical Guitar.  I also have a master degree in Computer Science from Northeastern University. Right now i'm working on my Doctoral of Education from the Johns Hopkins University. Prior to relocate back to Shanghai, I was a research bioinformatics scientist at Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle. Besides research and classical music, i like outdoor sports: hiking, kayaking, camping and snow-boarding.
